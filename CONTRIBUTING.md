# Contributing to @mcp-z/server

Shared utilities and server orchestration for building MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers

## Before Starting

A few conventions here differ from what you might expect:

- **Breaking changes over compatibility.** This project has no compatibility burden yet. Do not add back-compat layers, migration utilities, or wrappers for deprecated APIs - change the API cleanly and bump the major.
- **Keep it approachable.** This is a small community project, not an enterprise codebase. Prefer the simplest solution that fits in the existing files over new abstractions, frameworks, or shared infrastructure.
- **Tests use real components, not mocks.** Prefer exercising the real thing over standing up a fake.
- **Never write to stdout in server code.** MCP speaks JSON-RPC over stdio; a stray `console.log` corrupts the protocol stream. Use the injected logger, which writes to stderr.
- **Test scratch goes in the package's gitignored `.tmp/`**, never `os.tmpdir()`.

## Branches

One line. `master` is the only maintained branch.

    master          2.x    current    the v2 MCP SDK, both protocol eras

**The 1.x line ended at `v1.4.0` (2026-09-08).** That release carries the 2.x tree with two
compatibility aliases, so 1.x consumers could take every fix by upgrading in place rather than
waiting on backports. There will be no further 1.x releases, including for security.

`support/1.x` was retired with it. Nothing is lost: the tags hold the whole history, and the branch
can be recreated from the final tag if it is ever needed.

```bash
git checkout -b support/1.x v1.4.0
```

If you are looking at a 1.x tree, the two names that moved are `McpError` → `ProtocolError` and
`RequestHandlerExtra` → `ServerContext`. Renaming those imports is the entire migration.

`prepublishOnly` refuses a bare publish from `support/1.x`, so forgetting the flag fails the publish rather than moving `latest`. `npm dist-tag add @mcp-z/server@<version> latest` reverses a mistake at any time.

## Pre-Commit Commands

Install ts-dev-stack globally if not already installed:

```bash
npm install -g ts-dev-stack
```

Run before committing - this builds, type-checks, lints, and tests:

```bash
tsds validate
```

`tsds validate` also runs automatically on `npm publish` via the `prepublishOnly` hook; a failure blocks the publish.

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # Run the test suite
npm run test:engines  # Run the suite across every supported Node version
```

Specs live in `test/unit/`, mirroring `src/`. Cross-service specs live in `test/integration/`. Both run under `npm test`.

## Package Development
